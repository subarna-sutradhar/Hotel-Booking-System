# Hotel-Booking-System
This project is a representation of a hotel booking system that can be done by entering certain information asked by the code and give the user a simple and quick way to book a hotel


# Pickle

The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.
“Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, 
and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object)
is converted back into an object hierarchy. 

# Python Pickle Dump

`pickle.dump()` function takes 3 arguments. The first argument is the object that you want to store. The second argument is the file object you get by opening the desired file in write-binary `wb` mode. And the third argument is the key-value argument. This argument defines the protocol.

# OS

OS module in Python provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc.

You first need to import the `os` module to interact with the underlying operating system. So, import it using the `import os` statement before using its functions.

# def pcls():

This function is used to print all the places that are in option

# def rooms():

This function gives the user the choice to pick rooms as per the conditions given and calculates the amount that is needed to be paid and saves it in a `.dat` file

# Steps to Follow

1. Import the necessary libraries like os and pickle for file operations

2. Create necessary variables

3. Define a function displaying all the available places to choose from 

4. Define a function for choosing the room types available and calculate the amount from the no of days the user wants to stay

5. Create a login signin system . Owner can view the payments and the customer can book hotels

6. Create a function which gives the user to choose the type of hotel and calculate the respective amount and save it in a file particularly made for the user

7. The code creates respective files for the places available and also creates a file dedicated to the user and the owner for further future use of the program

8. It is suggested to place the code in a file and then run
