# Pickle

The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.
“Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, 
and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object)
is converted back into an object hierarchy. 

# Python Pickle Dump

pickle.dump() function takes 3 arguments. The first argument is the object that you want to store. The second argument is the file object you get by opening the desired file in write-binary (wb) mode. And the third argument is the key-value argument. This argument defines the protocol.

# OS

OS module in Python provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc.

You first need to import the os module to interact with the underlying operating system. So, import it using the import os statement before using its functions.

# def pcls():

This function is used to print all the places that are in option

# def rooms():

This function gives the user the choice to pick rooms as per the conditions given and calculates the amount that is needed to be paid and saves it in a `.dat` file
